  'programmable-family-treasuries': [
    'A joint bank account gives every signer full authority and no memory of intent. A shared spreadsheet gives everyone visibility and no enforcement at all. Neither actually encodes what a family agreed to — they just make it easier to violate the agreement quietly.',
    'A programmable treasury flips that. When a family agrees that withdrawals above $1,000 need two approvals, that agreement becomes a rule the contract checks on every request — not a norm someone might forget, or choose to ignore during a bad week.',
    'This doesn’t remove trust from the relationship. It removes trust from the infrastructure. The people still decide the rules; the contract just makes sure the rules hold.',
  ],
  'inheritance-without-probate-delay': [
    'Most inheritance planning assumes a court will eventually get involved, and that involvement takes time — often months, sometimes years, almost always at a cost to the estate.',
    'StellarNest’s inheritance vault gives a family two independent unlock conditions instead: a time-lock the Owner sets deliberately, and a dead-man switch that trips if the Owner stops checking in. Either condition, combined with guardian approval, releases the vault pro-rata to beneficiaries — no probate calendar in the loop.',
    'This isn’t a replacement for legal advice — the vault has a field for legal notes precisely because families should still involve counsel. It’s a replacement for the idea that a will is the only mechanism available.',
  ],
  'soroban-for-family-finance': [
    'We get asked why a family finance app needs a blockchain at all. The honest answer: for the settlement speed and fees, mostly not — a competent backend could handle payments fine.',
    'The real reason is enforcement. A rule enforced by a Soroban contract can’t be quietly changed by an engineer under pressure, bypassed by an admin panel, or overridden because a support ticket needed a favor. That property — code that even StellarNest can’t override — turns out to be the whole point.',
    'Stellar happened to already have fast, cheap settlement and mature primitives for multi-sig and asset issuance, which made it the practical choice for building this on top of.',
  ],
  'kids-and-crypto-allowances': [
    'Most allowance systems fail the same way: the limit is a conversation, not a constraint. A child asks for more, a parent is tired, the limit quietly moves.',
    'On StellarNest, a Child role carries an actual spending limit the contract enforces. Requests within it execute immediately; anything above it needs a Parent’s approval — visible, logged, and consistent regardless of how the conversation that day is going.',
    'Families running this report a smaller thing they didn’t expect: fewer arguments about money, because the limit isn’t a negotiation anymore. It’s just how the treasury works.',
